# Redshift_Flight_Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This project explores historical domestic flight data in the United States, spanning over two decades. The dataset originates from the [U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/) and provides detailed records of flight activity from 1990 to 2012. 

The data includes:
- A total of **96 million+ flight records**
- **23 CSV files**, each corresponding to one year between 1990 and 2012
- Approximately **6 GB** of raw data
- **GZIP compression** reduces the storage requirement to just **700 MB**

This dataset offers a robust foundation for analyzing trends in air travel, airline operations, and airport performance over time.

## 4. Launching Redshift Cluster

To launch an Amazon Redshift cluster, follow these steps:
1. Go to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to Redshift and select **Create Cluster**.
3. Configure your cluster (e.g., node type, database name, master username/password).
4. Launch the cluster and wait for it to become available.

I used 2 nodes of dc2.large type cluster.

## 5. Connecting to Redshift via Postrgre

Connect to the REdshift's endpoint via pgweb on EC2

## 6. Queries

Start by defining a schema: first, run a query to create the table, 

```sql
CREATE TABLE flights (
  year           smallint,
  month          smallint,
  day            smallint,
  carrier        varchar(80) DISTKEY,
  origin         char(3),
  dest           char(3),
  aircraft_code  char(3),
  miles          int,
  departures     int,
  minutes        int,
  seats          int,
  passengers     int,
  freight_pounds int
);

```


```sql
CREATE TABLE aircraft (
  aircraft_code CHAR(3) SORTKEY,
  aircraft      VARCHAR(100)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE airports (
  airport_code CHAR(3) SORTKEY,
  airport      varchar(100)
);
```

then load the data using the command below.

```sql
COPY flights
